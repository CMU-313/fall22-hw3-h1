# New Feature: Added New Data Fields and Statistics Page
## Usage
To use our new page, go on Teedy and try adding a few documents. These documents each represent a student's application.
You must choose a GPA, a GRE, and a score for each "student" using the dropdown selection. Then, save the document.
Try adding multiple documents/students and then click on the Statistics tab at the top of the page.
You should now be able to view the aggregated data for all the documents/students you added.
